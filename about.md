## Hey, I'm Jithin  ,

> Welcome to my personal repository of random ramblings.

I live in [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala#/media/File:ThrissurPooram-Kuda.jpg), India and currently jobless, I'm open for opportunities.

I donâ€™t [call myself a programmer](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/) but I like the idea of making a software out of your closet that would some day pay my bills and use my programming abilities as a tool to hack towards the goal.

I'm interested in [remote work](https://remoters.net/remote-work-trends-future-insights/) and is fascinated by the idea of working from wherever I want (Hate Cubicles). Apart from this I love reading books [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108741351-jithin-das) and bugging my little sister.

Say hello: *hello@jithindas.me*
