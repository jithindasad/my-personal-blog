I’m a Nobody trying to build something out of nothing and the odds are well against me. Chances are I may fail and It may well destroy me as I’m nothing but compounding failure with no growth gained from each.

But In order to have a chance at succeeding I have to stake my everything on It. I quit my social life for a long time by now never intentionally but the compounding failures in its side effects dragged me out of it into solitude.

As I savour solitude I looked inside me. What really mattered all this time? Was It money? Was It women? Was It self approval from others? As I lie in this no man’s land of mental state. It’s coming at me again and again what is that thing that matters? What am I looking for?

Perhaps this is a call the mystery of life is giving me. Is It asking me or perhaps begging me to at least answer It now after all this time.

Should I give an answer?

Am I too weak to think and give an answer?

Am I already too lost in the abyss?

I have no money, no job, no health insurance, nothing to support my family, I’m not strong enough for my dearest one’s to rely on me.

I have no idea if I’m going to succeed in my life.

Again the life is asking for an answer, should I answer him? Or should I run away from him as the coward I’m?

Perhaps I should.

Something changed. A sudden affirmation from life? He ask why? He asks why I should answer now? Because Ive never bothered to do that all this time. After all this failure. Why he asks.

Because the so called life around me is not built by someone smarter than me but humans just like me. I now realise life can be so much more. I was just pushing at the four corners of the construct of life people made. It’s well beyond the 4 corners. That’s why.

Why would anyone who strives to be original be a part of the trail of someone else’s thinking (As I would call them constructs: jobs)

Am I a rebel?  He asked me

Perhaps I’m. I don’t disagree nor agree because only time can prove through my actions If I was a rebel or simply a coward.

What are you going to do about it? He asked.

I have no idea If I’m going to succeed but at least I’m fully committed to something I care about. Fixing something that de-railed me from being something that I once wished to become.

You can call me a fool, a misfit, un-attractable, a guy who has no significance in a social circle, un-eligible, ill-skilled, lacks talent, a forever wannabe, someone who doesn’t live upto anyones expectations

But,

**_“I dare to dream the dreams and is foolish enough to try and make them come true”_**.

What’s your answer? The once nagging life now asked me with a pinch of surprise and enthusiasm.

> I’M GOING TO BUILD ON MY DREAMS!.

I replied with a pinch of enthusiasm. 🙂
